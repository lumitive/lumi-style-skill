"""Render a deliverable page by page and report what the layout actually does.

This exists because SKILL.md rule 4 says a page is done when a human reads it as
intentional, and 27 pages across two geometries and two palettes is 108 screens.
Nobody looks at 108 screens by scrolling. So the real output is a **contact
sheet**: every page as one image, per geometry, for a person to judge at a glance.

The numbers beside it answer the question a fill percentage could not:

  centerpiece scale    how much of the content area the figure or table occupies.
                       This is what "the chart is too small" means.
  aspect mismatch      figure aspect against its cell's aspect. A 5:1 diagram in
                       a 1.8:1 cell renders at 40% of the height however it is
                       scaled, and no amount of CSS fixes it — the drawing is
                       wrong for the page.
  largest empty rect   the biggest clear rectangle on the page, which is what
                       "looks empty" means geometrically.

**No judgement here gates.** Release 0.1.339 answered "the pages look empty" with
an 82% fill floor, satisfied it by stretching table rows, and shipped four
diagrams at 40% of their cell. A number that can be satisfied without improving
the page ends the looking.

**A check that did not run is not a check that passed.** Every summary below is
written `if <defects>: LOUD else: reassuring`, and until 0.1.350 the reassuring
branch also fired when the probe had matched nothing at all: a document with no
`section.page` reported "one horizon on each of 0 pages" and exit 0, and a
document whose class vocabulary differed from the probe's lost eight of ten role
checks without printing a word. Absence of vocabulary is not absence of defects.
So this file now carries the concept its sibling `check_design.py` already had —
`Unmeasurable`, printed as `NOT MEASURED (<reason>)` — and **exit code is 1 when
anything could not be measured**. That is not a gate on the design; it is the
difference between a probe that says nothing and a probe that says everything is
fine. The judgements themselves still gate nothing.

Needs Playwright with Chromium (`pip install pillow playwright && playwright

reports `NOT MEASURED` without it rather than disappearing.
