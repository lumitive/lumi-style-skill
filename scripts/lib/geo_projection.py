    t=0 is the globe and t=1 an equirectangular map, and every value between is
    a real geometry rather than a crossfade. Crossfading two projections has no
    coherent state at t=0.5 and breaks limb clipping halfway through; flattening
    the sphere itself has one code path and no such state.

    The plane spans 2R by R, so the flat map is exactly as wide as the globe and
    the 2:1 equirectangular aspect holds. Longitude is taken relative to lon0 and
    wrapped, so the seam moves with the view — see split_at_seam.

    Visibility interpolates with t: back-face culling at t=0, nothing culled at
    t=1, and the threshold moves between so no polygon pops.
