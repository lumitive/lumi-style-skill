"""The frame assembly both static emitters share.

Extracted from globe_svg.py unchanged in 0.1.392 so the globe emitter and the
region-map emitter (specs/2026-08-10-globe-map-split-design.md) draw the same
geometry the same way. The move is byte-output-preserving and the reference
diffs in that release's PR are the proof.

Everything here is form-agnostic: loading and decoding the topology, projecting
open lines and filled rings (clip on the sphere, split at the seam, project —
the 0.1.389 order), closing along the map's cut edges, the guard, the rounding
rule the JS renderer mirrors, and the sampled extent. What differs between the
two components — which layers exist, their classes, their ARIA vocabulary —
stays in the emitters.

       is determined, for a ring whose handedness is known by construction and

       jumps the width of the seam twice at every t > 0.

       crosses the moving antimeridian from drawing a streak across the map.

    Both edges are exact rather than fitted. At lon_rel = +-180 the sphere term
