"""Resolve the directory a finished deliverable belongs in, per design-rules §7.

The rule is `Documents/LUMI-Style/` under the user's home directory, and the rule
is the authority — it is written as a literal path precisely so that a model with
no filesystem and no tools can still write it down. This script exists for the
one thing prose cannot do: **find the Documents folder on Windows**, where it is
routinely redirected to OneDrive and localized into another language, so
`~/Documents` is a guess rather than an answer. On macOS it is the answer, and on
Linux the XDG user-dirs file is consulted first for the same reason.

    python3 scripts/ops/output_dir.py            # print the path and whether it exists
    python3 scripts/ops/output_dir.py --create   # create it — only with the user's say-so
    python3 scripts/ops/output_dir.py --path     # the bare path, for a shell to consume

**Creating the directory needs the user's authorization** (owner directive,
2026-08-09), which is why `--create` exists and why nothing here makes a folder
without it. A package that silently writes into someone's home directory is one
nobody installs twice.

Exit is non-zero only when the location genuinely cannot be determined — no home
directory, or a Windows shell-folder lookup that fails and leaves no fallback.
It never invents a path and reports success, because a deliverable written to a
guessed location is lost rather than misplaced (the 0.1.350 lesson: a tool that
cannot measure has to say so instead of reassuring).
