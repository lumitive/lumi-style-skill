"""Emit the static SVG frame of the LUMI region map.

The flat half of the component split (specs/2026-08-10-globe-map-split-design.md):
a map of trade regions coloured by identity, at the fixed flat geometry the old
globe called t=1. It does not rotate, unroll or animate — a static map has no
frame loop — so unlike the globe's frame this one is complete as emitted: the
runtime in assets/regionmap/ updates STATE (classes, values, labels) and never
touches geometry.

    python3 scripts/render/regionmap_svg.py                              # every region zero
    python3 scripts/render/regionmap_svg.py --states '{"europe":"live"}'
    python3 scripts/render/regionmap_svg.py --states '{"europe":{"state":"live","value":63}}'
    python3 scripts/render/regionmap_svg.py --labels zh                  # Chinese labels
    python3 scripts/render/regionmap_svg.py --lon0 150                   # Pacific-centred

Labels are emitted from the registry's `anchor` and `n`/`z` fields — declared
since the registry existed and read by nothing until this file. Each carries
`data-region-label`, which is the vocabulary check_design's D18 counts, so a
document using this frame satisfies the label rule without hand-authoring a
legend.

No literal colour appears here. Every shape carries a class and
`tokens/region-palette.css` ships the bindings, per design-rules.md section 1.

Standard library only.
