Rule revisions come only from review retrospectives (divergence ≥2 → retrospective
→ revision), recorded here with a version bump.

## 1.5.0 — 2026-08-07

Reader review of two shipped sales decks (zh + en, V1.3.0) against their own
V4.1 predecessor: "page titles suddenly became very short and AI-flavored,
overusing the it-is-X-not-Y contrast — this violates the PwC title principle the
skill was founded on." Measured: title length fell from a median of ~29 CJK
characters to ~8; display type rose 29.8pt → 37.4pt; every evidence figure
(18×, 4,557, 194, 29,845) vanished from the title line.

Root cause: 1.2.0 answered a review complaint about *visual* divergence from
spacex.com by writing a *writing* rule — "a giant short headline (3–6 words)" —
into design-rules §3, without reconciling it against the PwC title contract that
already existed in storyline-templates. The word ceiling then collided with the
still-standing requirement that a title be a complete assertion carrying the
takeaway, and with the negation-first signature's explicit de-flavor exemption;
in ~6 CJK characters the only form that satisfies all three is a bare antithesis.

- **The word ceiling is removed.** design-rules §3 now defers to the title
  contract; headline length follows the fact, bounded only by the two-line budget.
- **Title contract promoted to shared discipline** (was scoped to the consulting
  template, so sales decks had no title rule at all): "Topic: assertive subtitle",
  naming a subject and carrying a verifiable fact.
- **Information floor added**: a bare contrast, a slogan, or a section label is
  not a title. Contrast is a lead-in that must keep the evidence that earns it.
- **Two-line guard rewritten**: display titles are a size *range*; a long title
  takes the lower end before any word is cut. The old "shorten the title, never
  shrink the type" left cutting words as the only legal move once titles went
  giant, and the evidence went first.
- **Negation-first scoped** to the cover and hook, once per document; it is not a
  page-title form.
- **M1 is never waived for decks.** It had been marked "distorted for slides —
  advisory", which removed the only metric that measures this exact failure; the
  regression ran three versions unmeasured.

## 1.4.0 — 2026-08-06

Reader review of the anchor document (five annotated screenshots):

- Long-document callout hierarchy: three tiers (tinted+bordered key conclusion /
  left-rule guidance / muted note) — one uniform left-rule flattens the page.
- Charts: legend at the top right above the plot; two-part caption anatomy
  ("Figure N · Name" centered bold, description left-aligned at figure width).
- Flow-diagram shape vocabulary: parallelogram=I/O, rectangle=process,
  diamond=decision, stadium=terminal, dashed=not built — shapes carry semantics.
- Figure vocabulary ⊆ body vocabulary: body renames must sweep figure labels.
- Deliverables state results, not process: revision stories live in the ledger.
- Version lockstep refined: a user-assigned document-edition sequence (v1.01)
  owns filename+masthead; the colophon still records the producing skill version.

## 1.3.0 — 2026-08-06

Reviewer-driven round (five inputs from deck review):

- **Light-first**: the default canvas is near-white with the ink ladder; dark is
  applied only on explicit request via one `body.dark` override block. Both
  palettes share one token structure; literal colors in components or inline
  SVG are defects. Full dual-palette token set in `tokens/` (lumi-theme.css
  rewritten to v1.3.0; design-tokens.json restructured as palette.light /
  palette.dark).
- **American English by default**: when the user does not specify a language,
  output is American English (spelling, idiom, double quotes, serial comma);
  writing-rules §0 rewritten.
- **Icon-alignment guard** (from a reported alignment bug): an icon on a text
  line lives in a flex container with align-items:center — never a bare inline
  SVG nudged with vertical-align; icon ≈ 1.4× the accompanying text size.
- **Version lockstep**: a deliverable's version number is the lumi-style version
  that produced it; carried on the cover meta strip and closing colophon.
- **Cover and closing templates**: every deck opens with a typographic cover
  (wordmark / title / meta strip) and ends with a closing page (closing
  statement / recap / contact placeholder slots `[TO FILL]` — inventing contact
  details is inventing a fact / colophon). Added to storyline-templates.

## 1.2.0 — 2026-08-06

Direction change, reviewer-driven: "the output diverged from spacex.com — why?"
The 1.x fusion ("skeleton only, keep rounded type and light canvas") kept too
much consulting-deck idiom, and the one adopted SpaceX element (D-DIN in the
data voice) never shipped because the font was declared but not vendored.

- design-rules: decks are **dark-first** (near-black canvas, cold-white ink
  ladder); light canvas stays for long documents.
- design-rules: **D-DIN takes over** as the single Latin face; ALL-CAPS
  display titles at weight 400; rounded faces retired from decks; vendor and
  embed the font — a declared-but-unshipped face renders nothing.
- design-rules: one-statement-per-screen sharpened (giant short headline, one
  support sentence, one centerpiece, thin footer); hairline rows over card
  boxes on dark canvases.
- Accent green lifts to a dark-canvas form (#7C9F63); red text on black uses a
  lifted form while fills keep the seal red.

## 1.1.2 — 2026-08-06

- design-rules: added three field-tested guards from a reader-reported bug round —
  two-line title budget (shorten, never shrink); icon size independent of
  container scaling (blanket `svg{width:100%}` rules must exclude icons; an
  accidentally-stretched icon is not a design choice); in-row card alignment
  constraints (equalized title heights, stat numbers stacked above labels).
- design-rules: new "Verification matrix" section — language axis × viewport axis
  (design / print / short-laptop); footer rule and page number must be visible at
  every matrix point; height-based media queries as the mechanism. Supersedes the
  standalone localization guard (merged in).

## 1.1.1 — 2026-08-06

- Added the localization layout guard to design-rules: translated text runs
  30–50% longer/shorter — re-inspect every fixed-width container page by page
  after any localization pass. (From the English-deck audit: seven layout defects
  found — a wrapped stat band, ragged stat labels, and three SVG text overflows.)

## 1.1.0 — 2026-08-06

- **Repository language: English only — declared a red line.** LUMI serves a
  global audience; all rule prose, entry points, adapters, tokens, and this
  changelog are now English. Chinese strings remain only as rule data for
  Chinese-language output (banned phrases, punctuation patterns, collocation
  examples).
- Rules generalized to be output-language-aware: language-agnostic core
  (facts / voice / structure / charts) + a marked [zh-output] module; an
  [en-output] banned-phrase seed added.
- New field-tested layout guard in design-rules: right-anchored labels on
  full-width bars must anchor inside the fill (white-on-white invisibility bug,
  caught in per-page inspection).

## 1.0.0 — 2026-08-06

Initial release. Rules distilled from six rounds of real delivery polishing and a
first round of reader review on a consulting engagement's deliverables:

- Terminology red lines: no coined Chinese; direct English for concepts without
  an established Chinese term; substring-collision exemptions;
- Banned AI-tell phrases (with the "sales enablement" fixed-collocation lesson);
- Number discipline: sourcing, illustrative labels, repo-wide retraction with
  retirement notes for unreliable citations;
- The "value & future" sales storyline (boundaries converge to one trust page) —
  from a reader review scoring H5=2;
- "So-what is a writing discipline, not a page element" — from a reader review
  scoring H1=1;
- Plain-language scoring anchors ("anchors must be written in the reviewer's
  language") — from a reader review scoring H2=1;
- Five chart iron rules and form selection (partly adapted from
  enterprise-ai-skills, localized);
- Visual tokens v2: space-gray canvas + natural green single accent + China red
  warnings; layout skeleton informed by SpaceX/Tesla research (transparency
  ladder, dual-voice typography, cold-white dark canvas).
